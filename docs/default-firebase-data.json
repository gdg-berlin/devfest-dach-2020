        "description": "For several years now, that we’ve been trying to find new solutions on how we could develop a single project and run it on all platforms. We’ve been seeing all types of solutions: some are web-based, others require you to learn a new language, and others even may require that you pay a monthly fee to use. It also comes with the drawback that all your UI depends on the framework implementation. So, if there’s a native update you’ll need to wait until someone rewrites the widgets for you to update your app. Kotlin multiplatform gives us a new solution. It focuses on sharing your business logic across all platforms, leaving the UI to be implemented natively. Since it’s Kotlin, you can take full advantage of its language features - concise, safe, etc. Moreover, if you’re coming from android you might already be familiarised with Kotlin and even if you’re an iOS developer you’ll see that it’s quite similar to Swift.\nJoin me on this triathlon and let’s go through Android, iOS, and Web in under 30 minutes."

This competition has led to many of these Android libraries to implement various possible hack/tricks in order to get up and running inside host Android application as quickly as possible. Eventually leading to bad side effects introduced on the host application side.\nIn this session, you will get to learn about the various ways Android Library developers use to init their code inside the host application. You will also get to understand how these mechanisms work, what pitfalls they bring and where are these employed within an existing Android application. Towards the end of this session, the new and shiny Jetpack Startup AndroidX library will be introduced along with information on how to use it and what it brings to the table to solve the startup mess the Android Library ecosystem is in currently.\nBy the end of this session, you will be all set to build Android libraries that scale and have API which doesn't mess up with the startup of your Android application."

Fundamentally, a pipeline is a series of stages connected by channels, where each stage is a Goroutine or a group of Goroutines running the same function. My talk is aimed at enthusiastic Go beginners. It introduces threads/processes, briefly mentions deadlocks, explains the major differences between a thread and a Goroutine, goes over channels and demonstrates a working Go pipeline. (Note to you: I can include code snippets or do a live demo for the pipeline portion; there will be code snippets for channels/Goroutines). "

There is always the risk that a breaking change sneaks in by accident.\nWouldn't it be nice to get notified if you're accidentally breaking your users' code? A tool to inspect the binary API of your Kotlin/Java code can help you exactly with that. In this talk, we will see some of those tools and how that simplifies the life of library & SDK developers."

However, the serverless change the game and imply a false feeling of losing control, especially in the security part.\nThis session is focused on all the ways to secure the communication to and from serverless compute products on Google Cloud. The OAuth2 token generation and the difference of usage between access token and identity token, IAM service and the service/user accounts, VPC access and private networks access, load balancers, ingress and egress control will no longer have mysteries for you at the end of the session!"

In this talk I will map imperative best practices to the declarative world. You'll see plenty of examples and running code."

      "bio": "I love writing. That is, articles, apps and books. Also, I am a confessing mobile computing addict. And you can frequently watch me speaking at conferences and meetups. Being a child of the 70s my first encounter with programming was in the era of home computers. Those tiny machines (mine was a Laser 210) were usually fed with BASIC, which was the first programming language I learned. Later came C, Perl and a few more. During the 90s I wrote a bunch of programs for the Atari ST series. The first decade of my professional career was (inevitably) Java. Today it’s mostly Kotlin, C#, Dart and Swift.",
